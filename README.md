Statistics and Forecasting Class Project

This project explores the accuracy of forecasting retail alcohol sales and the factors that play a role in the process. I used three FRED datasets, including US Retail Sales, Gross Domestic Product, and Consumer Price Index. I split the data into training and testing and evaluated four simple forecasting models, followed by multivariate regression models, ARIMA, and exponential smoothing models. I found that the regression model, using season, GDP, and CPI as independent variables, is the best model for forecasting alcohol sales. The study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail alcohol sales and the economy in general.
